    "The function uses predefined auxiliary functions to calculate the pH as a function of $\\xi$. Note that for titrations of monoprotic substances, the shown graphs are generated with the analytic expression of the functions! For polyprotic acids, however, the graphs are generated by interpolation (this approach gave systematically better results). After evaluating the pH at some discrete characteristic points, sigmoid curves are fitted (using SciPy) piecewise through these points. Numpy and Matplotlib are used to generate the graphs and highlight equivalence points. \n",
