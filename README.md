Installation:

To get started with Moser.py, simply install the package using pip:

Copy code
pip install moser
Usage:

python
Copy code
import moser

# Example Usage
# Perform kinetics calculations
kinetics_data = moser.calculate_kinetics(reaction_equation, temperature)

# Analyze reaction quotient
reaction_quotient = moser.calculate_reaction_quotient(products, reactants, concentrations)

# Assess pH of a solution
ph_level = moser.assess_pH(solution_concentration)

# Trace titration curve
titration_curve = moser.trace_titration_curve(titration_data)

# Calculate concentrations
concentration_data = moser.calculate_concentrations(reaction_volume, moles_substance)

# Balance chemical equation
balanced_equation = moser.balance_equation(unbalanced_equation)
